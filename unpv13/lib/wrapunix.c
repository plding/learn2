/*
 * Socket wrapper functions.
 * These could all go into separate files, so only the ones needed cause
 * the corresponding function to be added to the executable.  If sockets
 * are a library (SVR4) this might make a difference (?), but if sockets
 * are in the kernel (BSD) it doesn't matter.
 *
 * These wrapper functions also use the same prototypes as POSIX.1g,
 * which might differ from many implementations (i.e., POSIX.1g specifies
 * the fourth argument to getsockopt() as "void *", not "char *").
 *
 * If your system's headers are not correct [i.e., the Solaris 2.5
 * <sys/socket.h> omits the "const" from the second argument to both
 * bind() and connect()], you'll get warnings of the form:
 *warning: passing arg 2 of `bind' discards `const' from pointer target type
 *warning: passing arg 2 of `connect' discards `const' from pointer target type
